        On the morning of January 7th, 2026, American citizen Renee Nicole Good was murdered by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent in Minneapolis, Minnesota. She was 37-years old, a loving wife and mother of three. Renee and her wife had just dropped off their six-year old son at school. He lost his father in 2023 and now has lost his mother too.

      <i>“They killed my wife. I don’t know what to do.”</i>

        The ICE agent who shot and killed Good was later identified by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem and Vice President J.D. Vance as Jonathan Ross. Ross and other agents were conducting illegal searches - “door to door” according to Vice President Vance - when Ross and her wife were caught in the middle, returning home from dropping off their son at school. Renee, driving their Honda Pilot, had stopped so they could film what was happening.

      <i>“We stopped to videotape, and they shot her in the head,” Good’s wife said, sobbing.</i>
      <p>
        President Donald J. Trump, Vice President J.D. Vance, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, and many other Republican Congressmen immediately began to call Good a Domestic Terrorist who ran over ICE agent Jonathan Ross – who they claimed was in the hospital. Multiple videos were immediately published from witnesses, contradicting the Trump admin’s claims. Federal agents illegally attempted to stop and remove Good from their vehicle. Renee was instructed to clear the road and leave the scene just prior, which she attempted to do. She turned the vehicle away, but Ross shot her in the head as he stepped beside the passing vehicle.

        Another video shows ICE agent Ross’s camera app open on his phone as he walked back to his vehicle. He then immediately fled the scene prior to investigators arriving. Ross had recorded the whole incident from his phone, which was later released by a far right news outlet and embraced by the Trump admin. He could be heard calling Good a “fucking bitch” immediately after shooting her.

        Jonathan Ross is no amateur, having served with the National Guard and Border Patrol prior to ICE. He is a Special Response Team supervisor, part of the ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations division. Instead of following his training and the law, he chose to film himself executing a US citizen in cold blood.

        The FBI is leading the investigation and refusing to cooperate with the State of Minnesota. If this were a local police officer or deputy, they would already be in custody, but DHS Secretary Noem has said Ross is home with his family. Meanwhile, another American family is reeling from the death of their mother and wife.

        Long has ICE terrorized Americans and immigrants in the United States. It’s time we put an end to that and abolish ICE for Good.
